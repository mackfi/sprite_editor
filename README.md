# sprite_editor

As this is an academic project for a CS course at the University of Utah, I do not feel comfortable sharing the code in its entirety.

Worked as a group of 6 using Agile methodologies and effective communication to develop a Qt/C++ pixel painting application. Implemented all planned features correctly with time to spare. I created an interactive canvas with brush size/fill/erase features. Other features include adding and deleting sprite frames, displaying animations from multiple frames, and saving/restoring sprite files.
